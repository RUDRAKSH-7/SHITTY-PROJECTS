# SHITTY-PROJECTS
## Leave this repo alone!



Well these are only some projects I made in the first year of coding (in 11th Grade). Don't expect anyone to see them but these really were some of my hard works which I **really** enjoyed making.
Surely these are not well refined and nor at that moment I wanted to refine anything, I just want to learn the efficient techniques of coding in python and C++
