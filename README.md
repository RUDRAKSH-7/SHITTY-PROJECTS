# SHITTY-PROJECTS
## Leave this repo alone!



Well these are only some projects I made in the first year of coding (in 11th Grade). Don't expect anyone to see them but these really were some of my hard works which I **really** enjoyed making.
Surely these are not well refined and nor at that moment I wanted to refine anything, I just want to learn the efficient techniques of coding in python and C++

# Files Include:
X O.py --> well its a tic-tac-toe game I learned off some youtube video 
            but implemented my own replay and colored text schemes (My Perferctionist self)
            
Mominos.py --> this is embarrasing, but its a food ordering app design, 
                which isn't anything but a basic interactive terminal based UI program. Named due to the fact that I was told to make it by my mother.
                
Dice.py --> this is a Dice roller that I made just because I was told to,
            took less time to make but more time to copy and paste the same type of code everytime.
            
Project.py --> ***THIS***, is the biggest File I made during the whole of class 11th. This contains 800 
                lines of code (PEAK TEKNOLOZY) which is mostly commented out because I was creating project given to me in a single file
                You wouldn't wanna open this cz it has nothing special but work that i put in to pass through the class.
